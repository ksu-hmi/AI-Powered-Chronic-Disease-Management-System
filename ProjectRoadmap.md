#Jordyn Notes:
I put the code in teh README file as well as explaining the inputs so that a certain person can get there results. I put a brief sentence on what the overall program was for after the code is ran. DONE
Find a way to make the existing code into an app for easier use:

I want to propose a few ideas to my teammates to refine our code. 
1. We could enter a section of code that prompts the user to quit after 3 failed attempts. This way the user does not have to be stuck in bad data.
2. A section of code that saves patient data to a csv file.
3. a section of code that lets the user do multiple entries in one session so the user does not have to start the program over and over again.

#Pooja's Keypoints
To enhance the accessibility and functionality of the AI-powered chronic disease management system, we plan to develop a mobile application for both iOS and Android platforms. 
This app will allow patients to easily track their health metrics, receive personalized health recommendations, and communicate with healthcare providers in real time. 
Additionally, we will integrate the system with popular wearable devices, such as Fitbit and Apple Watch, to collect real-time data on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep patterns, further empowering patients to manage their chronic conditions proactively.


Future Vision

Personalized Health Recommendations:

Leverage AI to generate customized lifestyle, dietary, and exercise recommendations based on individual patient data.

Blockchain for Data Integrity:

Implement blockchain technology to ensure that patient health records are immutable and secure, promoting transparency and trust in the system.

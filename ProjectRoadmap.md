#Jordyn Notes:
I put the code in teh README file as well as explaining the inputs so that a certain person can get there results. I put a brief sentence on what the overall program was for after the code is ran. DONE
Find a way to make the existing code into an app for easier use:

I want to propose a few ideas to my teammates to refine our code. 
1. We could enter a section of code that prompts the user to quit after 3 failed attempts. This way the user does not have to be stuck in bad data.
2. A section of code that saves patient data to a csv file.
3. a section of code that lets the user do multiple entries in one session so the user does not have to start the program over and over again.

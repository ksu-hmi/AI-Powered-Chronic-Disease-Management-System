This code references a suggestion I made in our project roadmap (suggestion #3). I like this change more than my other suggestions which is why I want to include it here. This could would allow users to make more entries without having to start a new session over and over again. 
def main():   
print("Welcome to the AI-Powered Chronic Disease Risk Predictor")
    
    while True:
        age = get_valid_input("Enter your age (1-100): ", 1, 100)
        bmi = get_valid_input("Enter your BMI (20-40): ", 20, 40)
        systolic_bp = get_valid_input("Enter your systolic blood pressure (70-200): ", 70, 200)
        diastolic_bp = get_valid_input("Enter your diastolic blood pressure (50-150): ", 50, 150)
        cholesterol = get_valid_input("Enter your cholesterol level (150-300): ", 150, 300)
        glucose = get_valid_input("Enter your glucose level (50-500): ", 50, 500)

        risk = predict_risk(age, bmi, systolic_bp, diastolic_bp, cholesterol, glucose)
        print(f"Predicted Chronic Disease Risk Score (1-10): {risk}")

        data = {
            "Age": age,
            "BMI": bmi,
            "Systolic_BP": systolic_bp,
            "Diastolic_BP": diastolic_bp,
            "Cholesterol": cholesterol,
            "Glucose": glucose,
            "Risk_Score": risk
        }
        save_prediction(data)

        another = input("Would you like to predict another? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()
        if another != "yes":
            print("Thank you for using the predictor!")
            break
